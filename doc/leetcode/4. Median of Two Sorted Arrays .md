[4. Median of Two Sorted Arrays](https://leetcode.com/problems/median-of-two-sorted-arrays/description/)
=

There are two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively.

Find the median of the two sorted arrays. The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).
```
Example 1:
nums1 = [1, 3]
nums2 = [2]
The median is 2.0
```

```
Example 2:
nums1 = [1, 2]
nums2 = [3, 4]
The median is (2 + 3)/2 = 2.5
```
