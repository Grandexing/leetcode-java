[11. Container With Most Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/description/)
=
Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an, where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Note: You may not slant the container and n is at least 2.

分析
-
对于ai和aj，container大小为 |i - j| * min(ai, aj)

解法
-
基本解法：步进为 1 - N，做两层遍历，计算所有可能的值得到最大值（o(n^2)超时）
